In this context, innovation in talent management has always been amongst the most important levers. From 360-degree feedback in the 1950s, to offshoring business functions for cost savings in late 1990s, firms have constantly adapted themselves to the needs of the talent market. Now, it is time for them to embrace remote work wholeheartedly.</p>\n<h2 id=\"history-of-remote-work\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#history-of-remote-work\">#</a> <strong>History of remote work</strong></h2>\n<p>Post the WWII, as the world economy started to gain momentum, large offices with cubicles started to appear. With phones, cars and planes becoming mainstream, international expansion started once again, with companies having presence across multiple countries. At this point of time, company offices were already working remotely to one-another.</p>\n<p>But it wasn't until the advent of computers, which accelerated the growth of the knowledge economy, and later the internet, that &quot;remote work&quot; as we see today started to appear. These technologies allowed individuals to collaborate and contribute without the need to be in the same location.</p>\n<p>Massive proliferation, improved reliability and easy access of these technologies has since  made remote work evolve from an occasional employee necessity, to company-provided perk, to now, a serious way of working.</p>\n<h2 id=\"encouraging-stats-for-remote-work\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#encouraging-stats-for-remote-work\">#</a> <strong>Encouraging stats for remote work</strong></h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Let's just start with one of the most mind boggling stats released recently by The Economist - there could be one billion remote workers by the year 2035!</li>\n</ol>\n<ClientOnly>\n  <Tweet id=\"1163345065017794560\" :options=\"{ conversation: 'none' }\" />\n</ClientOnly>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>\n<p>So, do we have to wait till 2035 to see a massive change in people's preferences.
