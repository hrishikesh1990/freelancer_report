With the rise in popularity of freelancing as a career among today’s IT professionals, there are a variety of places where you can hire freelance developers from.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.flexiple.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/How-to-hire-a-freelance-software-developer-16x9.png\" alt=\"How-to-hire-a-freelance-software-developer.PNG\"></p>\n<p>While a lot of solutions exist, you have to be sure of the use-case that you are going to solve. In order to select the optimal solution, some of the questions that you have to answer are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Have you decided on a screening and evaluation process?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>How much bandwidth can you devote to evaluating developers?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Are you looking for a quick fix, or do you have the time to carry out an elaborate hiring strategy?</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Answering such questions will help you select which source(s) to pursue to find and hire software developers. Some are better than others in terms of the quality of developers, some offer quicker turnarounds, and others are lighter on your wallet. Each comes with its own nuances.</p>\n<p>So, let's understand what each method can offer and its benefits/drawbacks, to help you with this decision.</p>\n<h2 id=\"hire-a-referral\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#hire-a-referral\">#</a> Hire a referral</h2>\n<p>Hiring a referral from a trusted individual in your network is one of the best ways to find a quality and reliable candidate. Having worked with the developer previously, your source has a deeper understanding of their strengths &amp; weaknesses. This can help them offer insights into what might work out and what might not – something that can’t be ascertained even after rounds of screening, much less found on anyone’s resume.</p>\n<h4 id=\"the-process-to-find-and-hire-referrals\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#the-process-to-find-and-hire-referrals\">#</a> The process to find and hire referrals</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><u>Scan your network</u>: Firstly, you need to scan your network for industry experts. Immediately, make a list of the people whom you’ll be reaching out to.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><u>Reach out proactively</u>: Do not hesitate to reach out to experts in your field. Try different channels like social media, email, or phone.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><u>Prepare a brief JD</u>: You need to let them know exactly what you’re looking for in a developer. One way to do that would be to prepare a simple JD that you can hand out (or) attach in emails. Don’t go overboard with the details.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><u>Offer monetary (or) non-monetary incentives</u>: To make it worth their time, you can also incentivize them. Be judicious about this though.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><u>Use LinkedIn</u>: LinkedIn is a great tool to keep track of the entire process and makes it really easy to start a professional conversation with a large audience.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h4 id=\"pros\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#pros\">#</a> Pros:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>High credibility of the source</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>As a result, greater reliability of the freelancer</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Gives you access to an evaluation of the developer’s performance under actual working conditions, which is invaluable</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"cons\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#cons\">#</a> Cons:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>You’ll be lucky to get a handful of shortlisted candidates</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Low volume of candidates means there are low chances of the engagement kicking off (because of variables such as the freelancer’s availability &amp; interest)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>High turnaround time – you have to be patient</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"what-will-it-cost\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#what-will-it-cost\">#</a> What will it cost?</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Nothing, unless the referrer wants a commission</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you want to incentivise people to offer references, it might cost you a few dollars to set up and implement a referral program. The incentive can also be non-monetary as well.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"vetted-freelance-networks\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#vetted-freelance-networks\">#</a> Vetted freelance networks</h2>\n<p>With the increasing number of freelance software developers every year, it is difficult to separate the really talented ones from the rest. A reliable source is needed – one that offers the speed to align with your company’s growth and is also able to maintain consistency in the quality of developers.</p>\n<p>Vetted freelance networks represent one of the best sources to find quality developers. Such platforms rigorously and holistically screen their developers. This involves going beyond the CV to gauge their abilities, through a combination of a specially-designed screening process and continuous project-based evaluation.</p>\n<h4 id=\"the-process-to-hire-software-developers-using-vetted-freelance-networks\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#the-process-to-hire-software-developers-using-vetted-freelance-networks\">#</a> The process to hire software developers using vetted freelance networks</h4>\n<p>Premium freelance networks have in-house experts to help you find the best candidate. Hence, you only need to share your requirements with them.

You post a job and will then receive applications from the hundreds of freelancers listed on the platform. While this is great for generating volume on your applications, you will have to spend significant time in screening candidates as there is no vetting process that is carried out by such platforms.</p>\n<p>This is suitable for small to medium work, where the main concern is not quality but keeping costs down. To help you select the right fit, these platforms have reviews and ratings of freelancers based on their performance on the platform.</p>\n<h4 id=\"the-process-to-hire-software-developers-from-pure-freelance-marketplaces\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#the-process-to-hire-software-developers-from-pure-freelance-marketplaces\">#</a> The process to hire software developers from pure freelance marketplaces</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><u>Sign up on the platform</u>: Firstly, you would need to create a profile on their platform in order to list a job.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><u>Add your project specifications</u>: While listing the job, you need to add details like the title, budget, necessary skills required, and a brief description of the work.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><u>Review applications</u>: Once you’ve posted a job, you’ll start getting applications from freelancers almost immediately, so you can start reviewing them.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><u>Carry out your own screening process</u>: Once you have a shortlist based on their credentials on the platform, you have to implement your own screening process to select the right developer.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h4 id=\"pros-3\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#pros-3\">#</a> Pros:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>You’ll get a large volume of applications from developers registered on their platform</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Huge choice in terms of hourly rates – you’ll find developers across a wide budget range</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"cons-3\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#cons-3\">#</a> Cons:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Freelancer developers aren’t screened for their technical ability</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You have to spend a lot of time and effort into screening</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It’s very hard to ascertain a candidate’s cultural fit for your company (there’s not enough data to make a subjective decision).

Further, such forums provide developers a platform to showcase their expertise to the tech community. This enables you to get a fair understanding of the depth of knowledge a developer possesses by going through their profile.</p>\n<p>Also, there’s usually a job listing page on such forums, which provides an organised way to attract developers who are looking for new opportunities.</p>\n<h4 id=\"the-process-to-find-and-hire-software-developers-from-online-tech-forums\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#the-process-to-find-and-hire-software-developers-from-online-tech-forums\">#</a> The process to find and hire software developers from online tech forums</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><u>Have a good presence on the forums</u>: Contribute to some of the conversations on the forum and engage with the posts.
