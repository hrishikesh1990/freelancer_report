**Show Notes**

In this episode, we had a great conversation with Darren Murph, All Remote Culture Curator at GitLab. Darren leads all remote initiatives at GitLab while also working on spreading the word about these initiatives.

GitLab is probably the biggest 100% distributed company at 900+ remote workers and on the path to surpassing 1000 employees across over 60 countries. While they just happened to stumble into remote working as the first three employees were placed in different countries.

This could have changed after entering Y-Combinator, but they just happened to grow as a remote team. The growth as a remote team from there onwards has been through highly intentional decisions.

The discussion helped us uncover why GitLab feels strongly about remote work. Additionally, Darren helps lay down the roadmap for a company to transition from an in-office setting to a remote setting, both through direct inputs as well as through Gitlab’s internal processes.

GitLab has started an “All-Remote Pick Your Brain” initiative to help answer and document questions related to remote working. To schedule an interview you can visit [this page](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/pick-your-brain/).

**Show Notes**

Scott Hanford, Director of Customer Acquisition at InVision, joined us on the Remote Working Show this week. He traversed the diverse worlds of Investment Banking and Entrepreneurship, to then lead product growth at multiple startups before joining InVision.

InVision, one of the leading design tools in the world, has about 900 employees and is a 100% globally distributed company. We explored remote working through the lens of Scott, who has seen Product Growth in both a co-located and remotely distributed team setting.

Scott shares how he stumbled into remote working and how InVision’s culture has helped him integrate seamlessly into his role. As a manager, he explains that while remote working can rid one of the in-office idiosyncrasies such as “face time”, it is still tough to address problems of a poorly performing employee. His solution to such a challenge is to be highly transparent about one’s goals and to micromanage such individuals in terms of their output.

In terms of building a culture, Scott recognized that intentional initiatives have not worked very well at InVision. Interactions that are organic in nature are the ones that have built a strong culture successfully. InVision is still trying to find other methods to sustain its culture as the company continues to scale.

There is a lot more that Scott had to share around remote work at InVision. Do hear the podcast and share your feedback!

**Show Notes**

In this episode, Dave, Co-founder & CEO of Hubstaff, joined us. Dave has been an entrepreneur for almost two decades and has now grown hubstaff into a $6 million ARR business.

Hubstaff is a 100% globally distributed company with over 50 remote workers. Uniquely, the company consists of all contract workers. Dave mentioned that this has been a conscious choice as many people on the team continue to pursue other things on the side, which is supported and appreciated by Hubstaff.

A successful and an experienced entrepreneur, Dave shared his thoughts on how VC/ PE investment early-on would have allowed them to grow faster but still feels that bootstrapping was the right decision for them. Hubsaff is also very open about all its numbers, which are publicly viewable [here](https://hubstaff.baremetrics.com/). This stems from their belief in transparency, confidence in execution, while also been a good source of leads for them.

Other than his views on the nuances of building a startup, the discussion helped us uncover how strongly Dave believes in remote working. He mentions how yearly offsites have played an important role in employee retention and to improve rapport within the team.

Hubstaff has documented their growth story [here](https://blog.hubstaff.com/grow/). Dave can be reached on <mailto:dave@hubstaff.com> and you can follow him on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dnevogt?lang=en).
