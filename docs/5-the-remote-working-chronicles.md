## #6: From Denver to Living and Working Remotely across 50 Countries

Reid introduces himself as a Voodoo Sorcerer and is trying to master minimalism. I really loved the way he articulated his advice: "Very few people are born into an environment that suits them best; some people never realize where they live inhibits their happiness. Zebras don’t belong in zoos and I believe humans don’t belong in offices."

## #7: Laura’s journey through Product Design, Travelling & Digital Nomading

I was quite intrigued when Laura mentioned how remote work has done wonders for her mental health as well.

In her words, "If going through a rough period, this leaves me with two alternatives: begrudgingly drag myself to work, or take sick leave. But remote work has empowered me to focus on work while staying in a more comfortable environment."

Laura has transitioned from an in-office job to leading a group of 40 digital nomads on a year-long trip and finally working a remote job at InVision.

## #9: From being a skeptic to a solid advocate of remote work

Gabriel was born and brought up in Quebec and his primary goal was to work in a field he is passionate about. Only during the interview for V2 Cloud (where he currently works) did he get to know that it would be a fully remote job. After being skeptical initially, Gabriel has come to believe that remote work is a huge perk and in fact, has become a solid advocate. He believes being successful at working remotely depends largely on how well you adapt yourself and how disciplined you are.
