## #1: About cooking pasta, writing JavaScript and working remotely

Francesco decided to pursue a remote career while in College itself. Passionate about cooking (everything mediterranean), he fell in love with Sicily, when he went there on a summer break, given the access to fresh ingredients for cooking and the gorgeous natural landscape.

Sicily wasn't ideal given he didn't even have internet access, so he moved to Valencia, Spain and has been in love with the city ever since. Francesco strongly believes that to be successful at remote work, you need to have the right attitude and a proper structure (planned and imposed by yourself) to your day or week.

## #4: Creating modern, pixel-perfect websites while freelancing (remotely)

Silvestar delved into remote working when he worked on his first freelancing project. He has loved almost every aspect of remote ever since. He says finding new freelance gigs in the initial months, was the biggest struggle in his remote career. He is thankful in a way to have gone through this period since it taught him that remote working takes time to master.

## #5: From Denver to Living and Working Remotely across 50 Countries

Reid introduces himself as a Voodoo Sorcerer and is trying to master minimalism. We really loved the way he has articulated his advice: "Very few people are born into an environment that suits them best; some people never realize where they live inhibits their happiness. Zebras don’t belong in zoos and I believe humans don’t belong in offices."

## #6: From a fashion stylist to a digital nomad writer and translator

Fernanda's journey has been no less than a roller coaster ride. Being a fashion stylist, she was tired of the constant back and forth running, being forever ready with outfits and super flexible with sessions' dates, crazy celebrity requests, to name a few.

She switched careers by moving to a writer and translator role with the Remote Year program. She's now settled into a full-time freelance role and continues travelling while working with clients across the world.

## #7: Laura’s journey through product design, travelling & digital nomading

We were quite intrigued when Laura mentioned how remote work has done wonders for her mental health as well.

In her words, "If going through a rough period, this leaves me with two alternatives: begrudgingly drag myself to work, or take sick leave. But remote work has empowered me to focus on work while staying in a more comfortable environment."

Laura has transitioned from an in-office job to leading a group of 40 digital nomads on a year-long trip and finally working a remote job at InVision.

## #8: From being a skeptic to a solid advocate of remote work

Gabriel was born and brought up in Quebec and his primary goal was to work in a field he is passionate about. Only during the interview for V2 Cloud (where he currently works) did he get to know that it would be a fully remote job. After being skeptical initially, Gabriel has come to believe that remote work is a huge perk and in fact, has become a solid advocate himself. He believes being successful at working remotely depends largely on how well you adapt yourself and how disciplined you are.
