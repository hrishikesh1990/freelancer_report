# The Most Comprehensive Freelance Guide

## Origins of freelance
The first written reference of the word "freelance" can be traced to early 1800s in Sir Walter Scott's novel "Ivanhoe". A lord talks about his army of paid "free lances". The idea was of mercenaries who didn't have an affiliation to any nation but rather worked for an entity or a person who paid them the most.

## Fast-forward to the modern context
Clearly, the usage of freelancers (or "free lances") is not new. If you were to fast-forward to two centuries into the future, the word "freelance" isn't esoteric anymore. In fact, freelancers have become the lifeline of many companies. There are really eye-popping stats that highlight their importance in modern business. Of course, instead of being mercenaries, less violent skills have been taken up with the concept of not having a strong allegiance to a company, rather than to a nation.
